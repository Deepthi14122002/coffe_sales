Coffee Sales Forecasting â€“ README

**What This Project Is About:**

In this project, we worked with coffee sales data to understand how sales have changed over time and to predict future sales. The idea is to help coffee businesses make smarter decisions by using data, not just guesswork.

**Main Goal**:

To spot sales trends and build a model that can forecast what future sales might look like based on past data.

**What I Did**:

Cleaned and prepared the sales data
Looked at how sales vary across time and categories
Used charts and graphs to show sales trends and seasonal patterns
Built a forecasting model to predict future sales
Checked how accurate the predictions are

**Tools Used**:

Python
Pandas & NumPy for handling the data
Matplotlib & Seaborn for visuals
Forecasting tools like Statsmodels or Prophet (if used in the notebook)

**What You Need**:

Make sure the sales data file (like coffee_sales.csv) is available before you run the notebook (cfs.ipynb).

**What We Found**:

Some months or seasons have higher coffee sales
The data shows patterns that repeat over time
Our forecast can help plan for future demand
